/**
 The MNFJob class acts as a wrapper for the Bolts framework developed by Facebook.
 
 A job contains a Bolts task and a task completion source both of which can be used to initialize a job.
 Additionally a job contains a reference to the URL request used to carry out server requests from the MNF framework.
 Therefore a server request can be cancelled if it has not completed by cancelling the job.
 
 A job should not be directly initialized but should rather use a Bolts task tompletion source to initialize with.
